# DSI09Capstone1-ExperimentalDesign

The overall goal of this project is not only to demonstrate, by example, the course content around experimental design but to find a path of focus for a World of Warcraft player to gain the highest amount of honor points if they were to play in the version of the game that was released at the time of the data collection (in early 2018). World of Warcraft (WoW) has consistently been one of the most popular and highest grossing MMO RPGs on the market since not too long after itâ€™s release in 2004.

The principles successfully demonstrated in this project:
 - Explored the data, handling null values, and looked into potential data integrity errors.
 - Outlined multiple hypotheses to be tested with identification of the dependent and independent variables.
 - Utilized data visualization tools in seaborn and matplotlib along with statistical hypothesis tests (T-Test, ANOVA, and Tukey HSD) to form conclusions and potential other considerations outside of the scope of this project.

Project artifacts in this repo:
  - wowbgs2.csv : Original dataset downloaded from Kaggle for analysis.
  - ResearchProposal-ExperimentalDesignCapstone - Proposal document outlining the scope of the analysis and methods to be used.
  - Notebook-ExperimentalDesignCapstone - Jupyter Notebook detailing the analysis conducted.
  - Presentation-ExperimentalDesignCapstone - Presentation slides outlining conclusions as presented to the DSI09 cohort for peer review.
